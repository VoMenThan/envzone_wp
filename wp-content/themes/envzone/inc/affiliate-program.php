                                And Get Rewarded. <br> <br>

                                Seriously... This is Going to Be the Easiest <br>
                                $500 You’ve Ever Earned!

                                Word-of-mouth advertising is our favourite method of developing new business. In fact, over 70% of our business comes from referrals. As such, we want to reward clients who are pleased with our work and refer us to another individual or business.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you refer our services, and we ultimately establish a website contract with that business, we’ll give you a $500 credit to say thanks. You can put it towards any of the services we offer, even your monthly ongoings. In theory, you could refer us just three of your friends and your entire year's website ongoings are basically covered. Pretty sweet, huh?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It’s just another way we give more... so you get more!
